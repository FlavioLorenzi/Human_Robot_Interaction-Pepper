# Human_Robot_Interaction-Pepper

AIRO project. Elective in Artificial Intelligence course: Human Robot Interaction
Università La Sapienza Roma

In Covid 19 Times, we are unable to test the code with the robot, but luckily there are alternative ways, with simulation.

In particular, thanks to modim server it is possible to simulate with a simple web page what should appear on the tablet (screen) of the robot: in this way it's possible interact with it and perform our aims.

## Approach 

![](pepper.gif)


Programming Pepper as an info point robot, putting them in a hospital (the Sacred Heart): it can recognize human faces and when a person is in a given range (checking with laserscan) the robot starts interacting.
E.G. "Welcome sir, what do you need? ... ".

Further tasks are implemented: -transparency conditions to put people at their ease; 
-privacy of patients is always respected;
-recognition of humans gesture (?) to understand if they need help.

In the end a final questionnaire is delivered to have a feedback on the people's feelings about this experience (HUMAN-ROBOT) and of course try to learn how to improve itself from them.

Furthmore a second task is assigned to Pepper: a night supervision role. If patients are out of their room, it stops them and starts the interaction: "Why stand at this hour? Are you sick? ... I am calling a doctor..." and so on.

## Documentation
You can see our final slide presentation in Documents folder (TODO).

Here there is also a personal slide presentation of the paper: Increasing Trust In Human Robot Medical Interactions

And then we have other papers that have influence our project ideas
